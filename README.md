## Database
Database is based on MongoDB and file `utils/connectMongoose.js` manage connection to database. 

#### Users

- Stores user information such as username, email, hashed passwords, and any other personal data (e.g., name, mobile number).
- A user can have multiple roles (e.g., buyer, seller).

#### Ads

- Represents an advertisement for a product or service.
- Contains details such as the product name, description, price, image, and condition toBuy o toSell.
- Each ad is associated with a user (the seller).

#### Likes

Represents the "wishlist" or liked ads by a user.
Tracks ads that users have shown interest in.

### Chat

Enables direct communication between users (e.g., buyers and sellers).
Chats are linked to users and ads, allowing discussions about specific ads.

### Transactions

- Handles all purchases and sales within the platform.
- Tracks the status of a transaction (e.g., pending, accepted, rejected) and links it to both the buyer and the seller.

### User Profiles

- Manages public user profiles that display basic information about the user (e.g., name, ads).

### Comment
- Enables users to leave comments or reviews on ads.
- Each comment is linked to an ad and a user (the commenter).


### Database Relationships

#### One-to-Many:
-A user can create multiple ads.
-A user can initiate multiple transactions (buy/sell).
-A user can like multiple ads (wishlist).

#### Many-to-Many:
- Users and ads have a many-to-many relationship through likes (i.e., multiple users can like the same ad).
- Users and chats are also many-to-many, as multiple users can participate in different chats.



## Internationalization
The project uses i18next for internationalization. Translation files are located in:

- lib/i18n.js: Main internationalization configuration.
- lib/locales/: Contains translation files in English (en.json) and Spanish (es.json).

## Authentication and Middleware
- Authentication is handled using JWT. The authenticate.js middleware is used to protect private routes.

- Error control: errorResponde.js and errors.js. Handles errors globally and returns appropriate responses.

## Email Services
- Email service is implemented with Nodemailer and cote for handling email queues.

- mailingService.js: Email configuration and sending.


## Sockets
Websockets are used to enable real-time communication in user chats.

Related files are located in the sockets folder:

- chatSocket.js: Controls real-time chat events.
